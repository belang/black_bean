Design Record
=============

Record the daily work.

- 2017-08-24
  Adjust the structure. Consider that if the BBISA can be a universal ISA.

- 2017-08-25
  Write the project code from the structure. Next to simu the core.

- 2017-08-28
  bb_core is ready to simulate. Next to write assembly compiler for BBISA.

- 2017-08-29
  design part BB Assembly Language(BBA), of which are directly consponded to the instruction.

- 2017-08-30
  compiler for BMI file to bmb simu file.

- 2017-08-31
  simu the rtl. to be continue.

- 2017-09-01
  succeed in simulation in writing an data from the immediate data to special memory address.
- 2017-09-05
  succeed in jump. change action instruction to source-target instruction.
  next Data register -> PC
- 2017-09-08
  restructure the core, change the instruction type to source -> target.
  next add IOSC_OTH data input support.
- 2017-09-11
  prepare to simulation
