Introduction
============

Current network is transfer station mode, which information is transfered by the router.

The Bean network is driver mode, which the transfered information(called package) selects the route.
Before the transfer, the sender knows the route information of the whole network, or
the receiver gives the transmit the road map.
When the router gets the package, the router only computes or gets the next station without the final target.

1. Routing information: who knows the whole network, or who decides the road map.
2. package: the information is stored in a package, so the router can't read the information.
3. router identification: from some information in a package, a router can identify the next router is legal or not.
